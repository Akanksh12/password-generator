## How to use:
1) Use pip in to install 2 packages which are pyperclip(https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/) and pyautogui(https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/)
2) Run the Password maker.py with any python interpreter(use 3.8 if any error occurs) or just run the .exe file from the google drive link(add to exceptions to use on your device)
# Note: Rediculous password lengths will lead to the program doing nothing, only use for normal password lengths (It works only till 65503 characters/length)
